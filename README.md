# JuniorDevInterviewPrep
**IN PROGRESS**

# Description
This is a repo for junior backend developers to practice interview questions and coding challenges. 
This is my final exam project for my backend development studies at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media. 
I designed the entire project, and decided to make it a fullstack application. 
The frontend is built with React, and the backend is built with Node.js and Express. Users can create an account, and 
then log in to access the coding challenges. They have the option to use flashcards created by me as well as create
their own.
